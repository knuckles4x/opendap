	I changed the way that stopNice_worker is called so thet the stop nice command is sent to the besdaemon synchronously. This ensures that the stop command always precedes the start command. Running the commands in the reverse order means that the beslistener is started when it's already running (which has no effect) and then stopped. That leaves the server in a stopped state. You can restart it by hand (but no one but us will every relaize that).

2010-12-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	In URLClassifier I used continue when I could/should have used break. Switching to break runs the code much faster (3:50 to process 127,000 urls with continue; 0:29 for the same 127,000 urls with break). The difference is that with break the searching stops at the first match of a URL and a group.
	I also added a size() method to URLGroups.

	olfs-wcs:  Removed catch for InterruptedException from drop method

2010-11-03  Nathan Potter <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs-wcs: This is a major re-working of the way in which errors are handled in the WCS. Prior to this we were absorbing all exceptions (by catching java.lang.Exception) close to where they were being thrown and simply logging the errors. This was an effective way to ensure that processing code always run to completeion but not very useful for production code that is running as a service and that needs to be stopped. I reworked the exception handling to catch individual exception types and added java.lang.InterruptedException to the throws clause on almost every method in the semantic processing. This, in conjunction with the finally blocks already in place, allows a supervisory thread to call Thread.interrupt() on the semantic processing thread and cause it to quit. Mostly. There are still (as yet to identified) places in the code that seem to be swallowing InterruptedException. In order to ameliorate this I added a ProcessManager class that carries flags that can be checked to see if processing should be stopped. I added calls to this in a number of critical places in the semantic processing. Additionally, I had to change the logic of RepositoryOps.updateSemanticRepository() to accomodate the situation where all of the required documents have been read in, but processing was stopped before or during the running of the construct rules. Without the logic change the construct rules would never have been run again, and thus the catalog would never be update correctly.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the way postgres caches are used. Now each site gets its own cache by default (i.e., it's own table in the crawl_cache db in postgres). Here 'site' is really the 'cacheName' parameter passed to ddx_crawler.sh but that defaults to the host name of teh catalog root URL. Reading from the cache has been fixed too. Also, I fixed a bug in the TCU class where catalogs were accessed twice (over the net); once to get the refs and once to get the data urls. Now the second access always uses the cache unless some combination of options has completely disabled it. A better solution would be to rewrite the TCU code.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ThreddsCatalogUtil and DDXCrawler are fixed so that the crawler does not require that the cache files be deleted on subsequent runs. But the TCU code still is making several references to the same catalog using SAXBuilder which uses lots of time.

	This version of ResponseCache can use Postgres (and has partial support for JCS, although it makes a weak persistent store since you cannot be certain items won't be removed from the disk cache). Other classes have been updated to use the Postgres-enabled cache.

2010-05-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Metacat no longer used for caching...

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added as a precaution... This version of TCU uses metacat as a cache - not complete, but see ResponseCacheMetacat.java for a look at a start. Metacat does not make a particularly good cache because of the processing it does.

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This snapshot of the crawler has changes that implement access to metacat - I tried using metacat as a cache for thredds catalogs, but it was fairly slow (as a cache) and required a schema and validation for any xml in a namespace). I'm going to try the JCS disk cache next...
	However, this code shows how to call metacat from Java. I will save off this version of ResponseCache to ResponseCacheMetacat so it's easy to find.
